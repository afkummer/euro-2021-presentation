# EURO 2021 - Solving the Single-Day Home Health Care Problem with Route Interdependencies

This repository contains the LaTeX sources to build the presentation I used in EURO 2021. I also added a pre-compiled version of the slides, and it is available [here](main.pdf).

This project uses the Beamer class introduced by Bruno Menegola in 2012. [This repository](https://github.com/schnorr/infufrgs/tree/master/slides) contains the original files that are currently vendorized within [infufrgs](infufrgs).
